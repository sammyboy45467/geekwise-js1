            <div class="point">
                We've talked about functions during our first few classes, but up until now we've not really looked at
                what they are, how they work, and most importantly, how we can write our own.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Lets define a javascript function as: <strong>a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a
                                                              value</strong>
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Functions allow you to perform a series of tasks, and return a value that can be used later.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                If a function does not return a value, it will automatically return <code>undefined</code>.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                All javascript datatypes have different functions that work on them.  For example:

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Arrays have <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, etc...</li>
                    <li>Strings have <code>split</code>, <code>charAt</code>, etc...</li>
                    <li>Objects have <code>hasOwnProperty</code></li>
                </ul>

                These functions are all built into each datatypes.
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
//string method, turns string into an array
//NOTE TO SELF...YOU MIGHT NEED THIS LATER...JUST SAYIN
var movie = "The Shawshank Redemption";
var moviePieces = movie.split(" ");
console.log(moviePieces);

//array method, turns array into string
console.log(moviePieces.join(" "));
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Ok, so we know that javascript has built in functions that perform tasks on certain datatypes, but wouldn't
                it be nice if we could write our own functions?
            </div>

            <h3>Creating your first function</h3>

            <div class="point">
                To define a function requires four things:

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>The <code>function</code> keyword followed by...</li>
                    <li>The name of the function</li>
                    <li>A list of arguments to the functions enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas</li>
                    <li>The statements that define the functions enclosed in curly brackets</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="excercise">
                    Try it: Create a function that logs "hello world" to the console.
                </div>
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
function helloWorld() {
    console.log("hello world");
}
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Lets pick that apart line by line:

                <ol class="list">
                    <li><code>function helloWorld() {</code> - the <code>function</code> keyword followed by an arbitrary
                    function name.  In this case <strong>helloWorld</strong>.  The function does not take any arguments
                    so we just have an empty set of parentheses.  Then we have an opening curly bracket to start our
                    javascript statements.</li>
                    <li><code>console.log("hello world");</code> - the functions body.  In this case, we are simply logging
                    "hello world" to the console.</li>
                    <li><code>}</code> - closing curly brace, ends our function definition</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="point">Great, run that in the console.  What happens?</div>

            <div class="point">Javascript functions need to be "called" or "invoked".  Simply writing the function
            only makes the javascript interpreter aware that it exists, it does not call it right away.</div>

            <div class="point">You call a function by using it's name, followed by a set of parenthesis.  Recall other
            functions we've used, the functions are always called with the parentheses.  <code>console.log(...)</code>
            <code>a.push(...)</code>, etc...</div>

            <div class="point">So, lets call our function
                <div class="excercise">
                    Try it: alter your code to call the function
                </div>
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
function helloWorld() {
    console.log("hello world");
}

helloWorld();
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">Now you should see your console.log appear.  So we called the function, and javascript
            executed the code found inside it.</div>

            <div class="point">
                Now, lets create a function that takes 1 argument, and log that to the console instead of the hard coded
                "hello world" string.  While were at it lets rename it to something more appropriate, like <code>log</code>.

                <div class="excercise">
                    Try it: Create a function called log that accepts one argument, and logs it to the console.
                </div>
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
function log(stuff) {
    console.log(stuff);
}

log("the fox jumps over the lazy dog");
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Notice, we do not use the <code>var</code> keyword when working with our function arguments.  The arguments
                are scoped to that function (more on this later).
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                <div class="excercise">
                    Try it: Call your <code>log</code> function without passing any arguments, what gets logged to the
                    console?
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="point">Great, now we're getting somewhere, we can define our own functions that accept arguments
            and do something with them.  It's also worth pointing out that functions can also call other functions.</div>

            <div class="point">
                Lets try something a little more complicated, but more useful.  It would be really nice if we had a way
                to capitalize a string, for proper names, etc...  Maybe js provides a nice way to do this:

                <div class="excercise">
                    Try it: Lets check and see if js provides a string capitalize function...
                </div>
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
var name = "Adam";
var capped = name.capitalize();

console.log(capped);

>> TypeError: undefined is not a function
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Lets look a little closer at that error... <code>undefined is not a function</code>.  In our example,
                we are calling two functions, <code>name.capitalize()</code> and <code>console.log()</code>.  Which one
                is likely giving us the problem?
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Since we know <code>console.log()</code> is a real function, it's likely that javascript is telling us
                that <code>name.capitalize</code> is undefiend, and thus when we try and call it, it's not a function.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                While js does not provide a way of capitalizing the first letter of a string, it does provide a way to
                upper case an entire string. It looks like <code>"adam".toUpperCase()</code>.

                <div class="excercise">
                    Try it: Create a string (variable or directly inline) and use the toUpperCase function on it.  What
                    is your result?
                </div>
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
console.log("adam".toUpperCase());
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                The result should be an entirely uppercase string.  So how can we use this to our advantage if we
                wanted to write a function that will capitalize just the first letter?
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Also, we want this function to accept a string and capitalize it, we need to be able to get that value
                back out of the function, this is where the <code>return</code> keyword is used.  <code>return</code> will
                return the specified value out of the function so you can use it else where.

                <div class="excercise">
                    Try it: Lets discuss how you might tackle creating a capitalized string using methods we've discussed
                    in the last few classes.  Hint: <code>toUpperCase</code>, string indexes, and <code>slice</code>.
                </div>

                <div class="sidenote">
                    In javascript <strong>strings</strong> are <strong>not mutable</strong>.  This means that when you
                    take any action on a string, you're actually creating a new string.  So it's important to realize that
                    since I can't actually change the string "adam" into "Adam", we can fake it by creating another string.
                </div>
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
function capitalize(str) {
    return str[0].toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
}
    </code>
</pre>

            <h3>Handling Edge Cases</h3>

            <div class="point">
                When writing functions (or any js program, really), it's very important to consider edge cases.  As a
                developer, it's your job to anticipate odd ways your function might be used and make sure it handles
                those cases.  What happens if you call your capitalize function on an empty string?  How can we fix that?
                What other edge cases might be useful to consider?
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
//this handles our case when no string is passed in (str is "falsy")
function capitalize(str) {
    if (!str) {
        return "";
    }

    return str[0].toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
}
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Notice the function now contains two return points, one for the case where we don't have a string, and
                one where we do.  It's also important to understand that a function will stop executing any code following
                a return statement, so if no string is passed in, nothing past <code>return "";</code> will be executed.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                What about making sure that the argument passed into the function is actually a string?
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                The <code>typeof</code> operator is helpful here.  <code>typeof</code> operator will evaluate the type
                of thing we are working with, and return that value as a string.

                <div class="excercise">
                    Try it: Use the <code>typeof</code> keyword to detect the type of thing we're dealing with.
                </div>
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
var name = "adam";
console.log(typeof name);
console.log(typeof 3);
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                So, how can we use typeof to ensure the argument is a string?
                <div class="excercise">
                    Try it: alter your original capitalize function to ensure that a value is passed in, and that it's
                    a string.
                </div>
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
function capitalize(str) {
    if (!str || typeof str !== "string") {
        return str;
    }

    return str[0].toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
}
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                It's often these "edge cases" that will bite you in the long run.  Always begin thinking about odd ways
                someone might use your code and anticipate how you could handle it!
